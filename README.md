# ColdFusion Custom Tags
This repository contains ColdFusion Custom Tags primarily used for UI generation.  These tags usually involve infusing JavaScript libraries into the CF environment, simplifying the capabilites of the library involved.

In the ColdFusion community there is a general distaste for the use of the built in UI tags in ColdFusion.  Some of this ties into the old Java applets, the Flash SWF's, old JS libraries, etc.  For me, the built in UI tags were always limiting simply because they were hard coded.  

I highly recommend an article by  Ray Camden on [CF UI The Right Way](http://static.raymondcamden.com/cfuitherightway/).  This article shows alternative methods to using the Built-in CF UI tags.

### Current Custom Tags
